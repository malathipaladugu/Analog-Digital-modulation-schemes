**Implementation of Analog and Digital modulation Schemes **
-----------------------------------------------------------

Simulation of Analog modulation schemes
Simulated Amplitude Modulations(DSB-FC, DSB-SC, SSB), Frequency modulation and demodulation and observed the frequency domain characteristics.

Simulation of Digital modulation schemes, Implementation of costas loop and Viterbi algorithm
Simulated the Digital modulation schemes (BPSK, QPSK) and To achieve the synchronisation of carrier frequency and phase costas loop is designed for QPSK signals and Viterbi algorithm is also implemented to remove the frequency offset
