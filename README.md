**Implementation of Analog and Digital modulation Schemes **
-----------------------------------------------------------

#Project1: Simulation of Analog modulation schemes
Simulated Amplitude Modulations(DSB-FC, DSB-SC, SSB), Frequency modulation and demodulation and observed the frequency domain characteristics.

#Project2: Simulation of Digital modulation schemes
Simulated the Digital modulation schemes (BPSK, QPSK) along with matched filter at receiver for checking the noise effect on the transmitted data.

#Project3:
Modulation and demodulation of 8-PSK is done. One direct and one reflected path is taken to create multipath environment. At the receiver CMA equaliser is used to mitigate the effect of multipath. Constellation with and without equaliser is observed and a text file is transmitted using this model and retrieved the data correctly with equaliser at the receiver.

#Project4: Implementation of costas loop and Viterbi algorithm
To achieve the synchronisation of carrier frequency and phase costas loop is designed for QPSK signals and Viterbi algorithm is also implemented to remove the frequency offset
